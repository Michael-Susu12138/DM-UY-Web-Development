                <p> Hello, my name is Yifang(Michael) Chen, 陈奕方, I was born in 12/26/2001, one day after Christmas, 
                    <br> and raised in Zhengzhou, Henan, China. When I was 14 years old, I attended North Broward Preparatory School in Florida and earned my 
                    <br> High school diploma there. I am currently a junior at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, pursuing a BS in Computer Science 
                    <br> and minor in Mathematics and Game Engineering 
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        When I was little, I like to disassemble stuff in our house. I enjoyed taking things apart and put them back 
                        <br>In fact, I cannot assemble the stuff back in most of the cases, so I messed up with a lot of things and 
                        <br> received a lot of complaints from my family as well.
